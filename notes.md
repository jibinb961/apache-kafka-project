## Random User Project

- First we install apache airflow python packge with the virtual env
- Next we, create a new folder called DAG, and dag stands for Directed Acyclic Graph which defines the workflow of a process that includes tasks and dependecies. 
- I have added a new pytyhon file in that called, kafka_streaming.py , which will handle the DAG operations through Airflow.
